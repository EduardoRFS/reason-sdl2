# reason-sdl2

#### Based on bryphe/reason-glfw. Reason / OCaml bindings for SDL2

#### Cross-platform Reason / OCaml bindings for GLFW - supports Native (OpenGL) and Javascript (WebGL))

## Building

`esy` is used for building, so if you don't have `esy`, install it:

```
npm install -g esy@0.4.9
```

- `esy install`
- `esy build`

> __NOTE:__ If you've never built with `esy` before, the first compile could take some time - it builds the `ocaml` compiler as well as `cmake`. Incremental builds, though, are extremely fast!
